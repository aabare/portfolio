# Professional Portfolio 

Introduction

This Professional Portfolio,prepared for Challenge 2, includes the CSS and HTML files. The website titled Professional Portfolio: Adam Abare includes three sections: About Me, Work and Contact Me. Each section provides a description and information about the author and his work. The icons presented in the Work section will link to two major projects including: Run Buddy and Horiseon. The portfolio was created to house information about the professional work created throughout the duration of Rutgers University Bootcamp and will be updated accordingly.

Usage 

Once on the Professional Portfolio webpage readers will be able to access information in the three sections: About Me, Work and Contact Me. Each section will be linked in the header, which will be accessible at the top of the page. A reader can click on the links in the header and be moved to each section. For example: if a potential employer would like to access information about the authorâ€™s work, the employer can click on the Work link in the header. They will then be moved to the Work section of the webpage which will include links to the described projects.
