        <p>
          My name is Adam Abare and I am an aspiring full-stack web developer.
          I am currently attending Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp with an expected graduation date of February 2, 2022.
          Through the coursework, I have learned how to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With these skills, I have created and refactored code 
          for Run Buddy and Horiseon. I am very detail oriented, organized, and determined which is reflected in my work for these projects.
          I strive to keep my code clean and well-maintained for the projects I work on.
        </p>
